# DrugSideEffectPrediction
# Description:
Developed a machine learning-based system to predict potential adverse drug reactions (side effects) using chemical, biological, and genomic features of drugs. The project leverages deep learning architectures to capture complex relationships between molecular structures and biological targets, improving early detection of toxic or adverse effects.DeepSide is a deep learning- based system designed to predict drug side effects before clinical trials.It combines gene expression data, chemical structure, and metadata for better predictions.This helps in reducing health risks and saving time and cost in drug development
# Key Contributions:
* Collected and preprocessed drug–target interaction and side effect data from public biomedical databases (e.g., DrugBank, SIDER).
* Designed and trained deep neural network models to predict drug side effects based on molecular fingerprints and protein interaction profiles.
* Implemented feature engineering and dimensionality reduction techniques to improve prediction accuracy and model interpretability.
* Evaluated model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
* Visualized model insights to identify high-risk compounds and understand feature importance in side effect prediction.
# Technologies Used:
* Python, TensorFlow / PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, RDKit, Matplotlib, Seaborn
